Compared to the original, this version was adapted and simplified to suit our project needs. The following modifications were made:

* removed compatibility fixes for older IE versions (`attachEvent` / `detachEvent`)
* added support for swipes and touch events on mobile devices
* user interface inspired by old Nokia phones
* removed some functionality present in the original, such as custom themes or mode switching
